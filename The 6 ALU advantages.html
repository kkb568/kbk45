	  <h2>1. 21ST CENTURY SKILLS</h2>
	  <p>ALU prioritizes the development of the seven key meta skills/21st century skills (with their respective key characteristics), which top employers around the globe seek and that define leaders and entrepreneurs. They are:-</p>
	   <br/>
	   <p><strong>(i). LEADING OTHERS</strong> - Empathy, diversity, Relationship building, feedback and collaboration.<br/>
	   <strong>(ii). ENTREPRENEURIAL THINKING</strong> - system thinking, identifying opportunities, human-centered thinking, creativity and innovation and continuous iteration.<br/>
	   <strong>(iii). QUANTITATIVE REASONING</strong> - data contextualisation, uncertainty and modelling of the real world, empirical research, data-based decision making and quantitative problem solving.<br/>
	   <strong>(iv). LEADING SELF</strong> - Self-awareness, proactivity, lifelong values, self-improvement and self-regulation.<br/>
	   <strong>(v). CRITICAL THINKING</strong> - Authentic inquiry, evidence/research, arguments and judgement and synthesis.<br/>
	   <strong>(vi). COMMUNICATION FOR IMPACT</strong> - Audience, writing process, voice, organising for effective communication and storytelling and presentation.<br/>
	   <strong>(vii). MANAGING COMPLEX TASKS</strong> - Scoping, struturing, planning, coordination and execution.</p><br/>
	  <p>Most universities hope that students pick up some of these skills during their education. At ALU, we intentionally and explicitly develop these skills in students through practice, on-the-job experience, coaching, and regular feedback. At ALU, you’ll prepare for jobs that haven’t even been created yet.</p>
	 </div>
	</div>
    <div class="slider1">
	 <div class="slider1-text2">
	  <h2>2. PERSONALIZED LEARNING</h2>
	  <p>At ALU, students benefit from an individualized, mission-driven method that’s just as effective and impactful as traditional ones. You can tailor your learning experience to your unique interests and passions with guidance from skilled mentors. You benefit from a sense of personal responsibility, confidence, and ability to direct your own learning—all traits that are important long after graduation. At ALU, you “learn how to learn.”</p>
	  <p>While pursuing your mission, you can interview experts. Conduct field studies. Shadow professionals. Watch TED talks. And so much more, based on your individual goals. You’re empowered to be the driving force behind your bachelor’s or master’s degree experience. You and your peers have the power to design your extra-curricular activities, launch your own ventures, and engage in local communities.</p>
	  <p>Our <strong>student-centered learning model</strong> is all about you. You structure your learning around your passions and your mission. There are big global challenges to solve. At ALU, we believe <strong>our students should be the problem solvers</strong>.</p>
	 </div>
	</div>
	<div class="slider1">
	 <div class="slider1-text3">
	  <h2>3. VALUES & CHARACTER</h2>
	  <p>As technology becomes more ingrained in everyday life, human values and traits like <strong>perseverance, resilience, ethics, empathy, passion, courage, teamwork, integrity, emotional intelligence, curiosity, initiative, persistence, grit,</strong> and <strong>adaptability</strong> become more valuable—perhaps even more than “facts and figures” (which computers can learn).</p>
	  <p>These traits aren’t “nice to have”—they’re a fundamental requirement of higher education. In order to future-proof graduates, ALU guides students through deliberate experiences aimed at developing the right character and mindset. This strong belief allows us to develop our students into the leaders and entrepreneurs of the future. In this way, we build tomorrow’s innovative leaders.</p>
	  <p>A fulfilling student experience involves more than just academics. It requires a holistic combination of student life, campus life, and culture in addition to character- and value-building.</p>
	 </div>
	</div>
	<div class="slider1">
	 <div class="slider1-text4">
	  <h2>4. CAREER DEVELOPMENT & WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
	  <p>Many universities provide little to no practical work experience. They don’t start talking about life after graduation until a student’s final year. At ALU, students begin their career development journey on day one. Students benefit from a <strong>four-month-long internship during each year of study</strong>.
      By the time you graduate, you’ll have a full year of work experience in a variety of organizations. This experience enables you to build deep connections with potential employers and provides practice in solving real-world problems. You’ll have been exposed to the world of work, giving you an advantage over traditional university graduates in gaining employment or starting your own organization.</p>
	  <p>Our approach to career development is centered on five pillars that research, top global employers, and entrepreneurship incubators have said are the keys to thriving in the professional world. They are:-</p>
	  <p><strong>(i)Building a core character.<br/><br/>
	  (ii)Developing 21st-century skills.<br/><br/>
	  (iii)Building experience.<br/><br/>
	  (iv)Gaining perspective.<br/><br/>
	  (v)Building a network.</strong></p>
	  <p>In addition to career development and internships, ALU students have opportunities to do real work throughout the year. The first-year <strong>Projects Course</strong> exposes students to real life problems by allowing them to work on unique real-time projects with clients in different industries. Those who are interested in entrepreneurship can apply to the <strong>Student Ventures Program</strong>, a series of structured experiences and resources to help ALU students develop their entrepreneurial skills.</p>
	 </div>
	</div>
	<div class="slider1">
	 <div class="slider1-text5">
	  <h2>5. A NETWORK</h2>
	  <p>Leadership skills alone are not enough to make maximum impact. Effective leaders require a powerful network of peers, investors, mentors, and more to achieve their full potential.</p>
	  <p>ALU students become part of a talented, diverse community from around the world. They are surrounded by driven, talented, and passionate classmates. They are exposed to ALU’s unique and powerful network of mentors, guest speakers, experts-in-residence, industry leaders, investors, ALU staff, and employers. They participate in events like <strong>the African Leadership Network</strong> and are provided opportunities to attend conferences where they can meet a broader set of influential people.</p>
	  <p>Undergraduate students can also develop a diverse network by connecting with students in our postgraduate offerings like <strong>the ALU School of Business</strong> for business professionals, <strong>the Africa Industrial Internet Program</strong> for data science professionals, and <strong>ALX</strong>, our continuing education and professional development program.</p>
	  <p>With students from over 29 countries and staff from across the globe, ALU is one of the most diverse university experiences available. Join bright, passionate, like-minded peers to share, explore, and celebrate culture and diversity.</p>

	 <div class="slider1-text6">
	  <h2>6. STAMP OF APPROVAL</h2>
	  <p>Research known as the Signaling Theory of Universities shows that the greatest value that a university degree provides is its “stamp” of credibility. It’s a signal to potential employers that the graduate is an intelligent, work-ready individual.</p>
	  <p>ALU offers <strong>fully-accredited and internationally-recognized degrees</strong> that carry weight around the world. Because ALU provides such a robust, well-rounded education, our good name ensures students will wear our “stamp of approval” with pride. Graduates can be assured that a degree from ALU is a signal of credibility, one that’s attractive to employers and potential investors in the graduate’s entrepreneurial ventures.</p>
	  <p>We’re proud to work with our fine academic and accreditation partners. ALC Mauritius is accredited through the Tertiary Education Commission in partnership with <strong>Glasgow Caledonian University</strong>, a modern, multicultural university with campuses in Glasgow, London, and New York. This enables us to offer internationally-recognized UK degrees. ALU Rwanda is accredited through the Higher Education Commission.</p>
	  <p>Media around the world have hailed ALU as an innovative, forward-thinking institution. It’s been recognized by outlets including <strong>the New York Times, the BBC,</strong> and <strong>New African magazine</strong>. CNN called us “the best in the country” and <strong>“The Harvard of Africa”.</strong>  And in 2019, ALU was named one the <strong>#1 most innovative company in Africa</strong> and <strong>#39 most innovative in the world</strong> by Fast Company.</p>

    <h1>OUR APPROACH</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="container17">
   <p>ALU goes above and beyond to provide you with an education like no other. We focus on giving you a holistic experience designed to make you a successful entrepreneur, leader and a better citizen of the world. ALU has identified several fundamental strategies that make our approach to teaching and learning unique, relevant and engaging, which are the following:-</p>
  </div>
  <div class="container18">
   <div class="slider-show2">
    <div class="slider2">
	 <div class="slider2-text1">
	  <h2>1. PREPARATION FOR TOMORROW’S WORLD</h2>
	  <p>In an ever-changing world, narrow academic theory quickly loses relevance. Therefore we go beyond just giving you a solid academic grounding. We also develop skills like leadership, critical thinking, problem solving, quantitative reasoning, communication and teamwork—skills that will always be relevant for the jobs of tomorrow.</p>
	 </div>
	</div>
    <div class="slider2">
	 <div class="slider2-text2">
	  <h2>2. AN ENGAGING LEARNING EXPERIENCE</h2>
	  <p>We employ the most innovative and effective methods of teaching and learning. For example, we ban lectures. Instead, you drive your own learning in a self-paced way and learn from your peers. When you attend class, you will meet an expert facilitator who engages you in lively debates, discussions, and applications of the knowledge you have learned on your own and with peers. You will ‘learn how to learn’ in an effective and engaging way.</p>
	  <p>We have developed a Learning Cycle that helps you learn new skills and master concepts. This 4-part Learning Cycle incorporates:-<br/><br/><strong>
	  (i) a ‘discovery’ experience—that ‘aha’ moment when you discover the gaps in your knowledge and skills.<br/>
	  (ii) Self-paced learning.<br/>
	  (iii) Peer learning (students teaching and learning from each other).<br/> 
	  (iv) Facilitated group learning.</strong></p>
	 </div>
	</div>
	<div class="slider2">
	 <div class="slider2-text3">
	  <h2>3. DECLARE A MISSION FOR YOUR LIFE</h2>
	  <p>We will challenge you to declare a “mission” for your life, and not just to select an academic “major”. We will expose you to the grand challenges and opportunities of our time, and work with you to define how you want to solve these problems and capture emerging opportunities. In this way, you will discover your life’s purpose and align your learning with this purpose.</p>
	 </div>
	</div>
	<div class="slider2">
	 <div class="slider2-text4">
	  <h2>4. EDUCATION MEETS THE REAL WORLD</h2>
	  <p>We break down barriers between universities and the real world. You will solve real problems for real organizations from day one. We design our curriculum with employers. And each year, in our undergraduate programs, you spend 8 months studying and up to 4 months in the workplace, ensuring you have one year of work experience by the time you graduate and are ‘ready to hit the ground running’.</p>
	 </div>
	</div>
	<div class="slider2">
	 <div class="slider2-text5">
	  <h2>5. DEVELOPING ENTREPRENEURIAL LEADERS</h2>
	  <p>We believe every graduate in the 21st century should be able to think entrepreneurially. Therefore, you learn the habits that make great entrepreneurs—how to solve big problems with limited resources, how to think innovatively, how to form and lead teams, and how to dream big—in whatever field you go into.</p>
	 </div>
	</div>
	<div class="slider2">
	 <div class="slider2-text6">
	  <h2>6. PAN-AFRICAN AND GLOBAL NETWORK</h2>
	  <p>At ALU, we believe that creativity is fostered by experience and exposure, and as such we bring together students and staff from all the 54 countries of Africa and around the world to live, study, and play together in a rich, vibrant community where different cultures are respected and celebrated. You form deep bonds with inspiring classmates and graduate with a powerful, global network for life.</p>
	 </div>
	</div>
	<div class="slider2">
	 <div class="slider2-text7">
	  <h2>7. A STUDENT DRIVEN EXPERIENCE</h2>
	  <p>We empower you to be the driving force behind your undergraduate experience. You and your peers have the power to design your extra-curricular activities, and are supported to launch your own ventures, engage in local communities, and participate in our total wellness programme, ALUAlive.</p>
